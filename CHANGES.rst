To do
-----
Rather than a to-do list, here are some possible future improvements:
    - (?) use https://www.jsdelivr.com/?docs=gh to link to java and css files via github
            => works out of the box without the need to install local javascript and css files
            => no need to upgrade javascript when upgrading
            => could track usage
    - (?) improve quiz "security" (would be a side-effect of moving to vue...)
    - (?) randomise order of questions parts with document-class option randomorder
    - (?) allow variables in questions (hardest part is finding a good syntax)
    - (?) rewrite javascript to use vue to render and control quiz pages
    - (?) allow vertical/horizontal/none customisations of question buttons
    - (?) record marks of students...would need an interface for login details etc
    - (?) add timer and/or time limits to quiz
    - (?) responsive columns to replace columns=? in choice environments
    - (?) dynamic themes (easy)
    - (?) dynamic languages (harder)
